“I believe that everything happens for a reason. People change so that you can learn to let go, things go wrong so that you appreciate them when they're right, you believe lies so you eventually learn to trust no one but yourself, and sometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together.” 

“There are only two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle.” 

“It is better to remain silent at the risk of being thought a fool, than to talk and remove all doubt of it.”
